We have plenty of money, and why should we stay?”</p><p>Farfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move, and they talked thereon till a visitor was announced. Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came in.</p><p>“You've heard, I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfield's death? Yes—died this afternoon at five,” said Mr. Vatt.
